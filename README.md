**Enter the exciting world of Julia, a high-performance language for technical computing**

## What is this book about?
The release of Julia 1.0 is now ready to change the technical world by combining the high productivity and ease of use of Python and R with the lightning-fast speed of C++. Julia 1.0 programming gives you a head start in tackling your numerical and data problems. You will begin by learning how to set up a running Julia platform, before exploring its various built-in types. With the help of practical examples, this book walks you through two important collection types: arrays and matrices. In addition to this, you will be taken through how type conversions and promotions work.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up your Julia environment to achieve high productivity 
* Create your own types to extend the built-in type system 
* Visualize your data in Julia with plotting packages 
* Explore the use of built-in macros for testing and debugging, among other uses 
* Apply Julia to tackle problems concurrently 
Integrate Julia with other languages such as C, Python, and MATLAB

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
for arg in ARGS 
    println(arg) 
end 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is intended for data scientists and all those who work on technical and scientific computation projects. It will get you up and running quickly with Julia to start simplifying your projects' applications. The book assumes you already have some basic working knowledge of a high-level dynamic language such as MATLAB, R, Python, or Ruby.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
